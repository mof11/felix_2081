        <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
        <p class="first">Known as the most versatile working dog, the German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP) is a gun
            dog that combines agility, power, and endurance. This bred encompasses a square form,
            strong quarters, and an athletic physique. The coat is short, and usually a mixure of
            the colors brown and white. They are known to be lovers of the outdoors and hunting, as
            well as curling up next to their owners' sides. GSPs are very active dogs and require at
            least one hour of exercise daily. They are known to be a sensitive breed, and responsive
            to training.</p>
        <h2><b>History</b></h2>
        <p>The versatility of GSPs (which include pointing, retrieving, and trailing) began through
            the blending various breeds beginning in the 17th century. The crossbreeding began with
            the Spanish pointer and the Hannover hound that resulted in offspring that were very
            houndlike that had the capability to both trail and point. The result was also they
            liked to hunt for birds and mammals. Then came along to crossbreed with the English
            pointer, which made these dogs more aesthetically appealing and sharper hunting
            instincts. However, they became dogs that did not like water and had an aversion to
            attacking quarry. But after further breeding and time, these undesirable characteristics
            disappeared. In the early 1800s, two GSPs (then called Deutsch kurzhaars), Nero and
            Treff, became the stars against the other pointing breeds at the German Derby. And these
            two dogs started the foundation for the success of the versatility of the GSPs. The
            breed was then recognized in the late 1800s and the first shorthaired came to America in
            1920. The GSP gained AKC (American Kennel Club) recognition in 1930. GSPs are known to
            be talented hunters and obedient companions.</p>

        <h2><b>Personality</b></h2>
        <p>German Shorthaired Pointers are considered to be wonderful and loving family dogs. Their
            attributes compose of a calm (and friendly) demeanor, high level of intelligence, and
            loyal nature. They have two sides in their personality: one side is when they are at
            home, content to be there and affectionate towards their families (most of the time they
            like to always be with someone). The other side is when they are in the field,
            completely focused on the task at hand on pointing, retreiving, and other tasks involved
            in hunting. </p>
        <h2><b>Fun Facts</b></h2>
        <ol>
            <li> The GSP was elected mayor of all pets in Monclair, California. </li>
            <li> Served alongside in the AirForce in Operation Iraqi, detecting bombs</li>
            <li> A mixture of several breeds: Spanish Pointer, English Pointer, Dalmation,
                Wimerwiner, Tracking Hound, German Birddog, and the Vizsla.</li>
            <li> Due to the variety of breeds that resulted in the modern GSP, their coloring is
                quite varied too. They can be a mixture of brown and white, mostly brown, mostly
                white, black, a mixture of black and white, etc. An indicator to determine the true
                color of a GSP is to check the nose color.</li>
            <li> Their coat is very water-resistent and their paws are webbed, making them efficient
                water dogs. Their coat also repels dirt, which makes grooming an easier task.</li>

        <h2><b>My GSP</b></h2>

        <p> This is my German Shorthaired Pointer, Tootsie! She is now 9 years old, but still is the
            baby of the family. After the constant persistence of my younger sister to get a dog, my
            mom finally relented and we adopted Tootsie when she was seven months old at Vogel Hund
            Kennel in Wellsburgh, WV. She was already house-trained and had been exposed to months
            of hunting practice with Ron, her previous owner and the dog trainer. My mom, not fond
            of the idea of getting a dog, was not crazy about having Tootsie and actually wanted to
            take her back after a month of having her. However, the two warmed up to each other and
            Tootsie soon imprinted on my mom. They have been inseparable ever since and it is safe
            to say that my mom loves that dog more than us three kids combined! </p>
        <p> Tootsie is such a loving and loyal dog. She always wants to be around someone (usually
            my mom) and loves when she receives attention and affection. Also, she always sleeps
            next to someone in my family at night. Even at her older age, she still requires at
            least an hour of exercise at the park each day, as well as an evening walk. My dad
            occassionally hunts and will take her along, since she is a very gifted hunting dog. We
            still take her back to the kennel in WV to her old family (they adore her!) when we go
            on a vacation a few times a year. Tootsie is the best dog we could have asked for!</p>
